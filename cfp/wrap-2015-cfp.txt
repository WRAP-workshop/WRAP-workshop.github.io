First International Workshop on Representative Applications (WRAp 2015)
                    http://wrap-workshop.github.io/

            to be held in conjunction with IEEE Cluster 2015

The First International Workshop on Representative Applications is
concerned with the development and use of representative applications
(mini-applications or proxies) for all aspects of high-performance
computing.

The challenges posed by future systems: new architectures, programming
models, and machine scales; mean that representative applications as an
essential tool in the path towards exascale. These applications can be
used for acceptance testing, benchmarking, optimization evaluation, and
also investigating the performance of new architectures or programming
models. However, the development of such representative applications
must ensure they maintain some correspondence with their parent
application, so requires methods and tools for identifying the
performance critical aspects of a given code, or class of codes, and
also for verifying that the proxy effectively models the the target
behavior.

The main aim of WRAp is to provide a venue in which the wide range of
disciplines involved in creating and using representative applications
can share important discoveries and lessons learned from these
applications.

We encourage submissions on all aspects of the design, creation and use
of representative applications, including (but not limited to):

- Programming model and language explorations
- Design and generation of representative applications
- New representative applications
- Verification and validation of representative applications
- Optimizations, including:
  - algorithmic improvements, and
  - code optimization
- Scalability studies
- Hardware studies
- Case-studies of representative applications impacting their parent
  code

Work which examines similar topics will also be considered for inclusion
in the workshop.
