# <small>09:00 - 10:00</small> Keynote

- **Making Representative Apps Represent Apps**, Dr. Michael Heroux.

Representative Apps play a very important role design space exploration.  If
well designed and implemented they provide a distilled model of some aspect of
real applications, providing much simpler target for computer system designer to
address.  Furthermore, representative apps can be re-designed and implemented in
many settings, giving guidance on how future real applications can be recast.

In this presentation, we give a brief history of representative apps, provide
some guidance on how to design and implement them and talk about some of our
latest work in this area.  We draw upon experiences from the Mantevo and HPCG
benchmark projects in order to provide concrete examples.
