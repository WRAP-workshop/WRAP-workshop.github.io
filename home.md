Held as part of IEEE Cluster 2015, the First International Workshop on
Representative Applications is concerned with the development and use of
representative applications (such as mini-applications or proxies) for all
aspects of high-performance computing.

The challenges posed by future systems: new architectures, programming models,
and machine scales; mean that representative applications as an essential tool
in the path towards exascale. These applications can be used for acceptance
testing, benchmarking, optimization evaluation, and also investigating the
performance of new architectures or programming models. However, the development
of such representative applications must ensure they maintain some
correspondence with their parent application, so requires methods and tools for
identifying the performance critical aspects of a given code, or class of codes,
and also for verifying that the proxy effectively models the the target
behavior. 

The main aim of WRAp is to provide a venue in which the wide range of
disciplines involved in creating and using representative applications can share
important discoveries and lessons learned from these applications. 

We encourage submissions on all aspects of the design, creation and use of
representative applications, including (but not limited to):

- Programming model and language explorations.
- Design and generation of representative applications.
- New representative applications.
- Verification and validation of representative applications.
- Optimizations, including:
  - algorithmic improvements, and
  - code optimization.
- Scalability studies.
- Hardware studies.
- Case-studies of representative applications impacting their parent code.

Work which examines similar topics will also be considered for inclusion in the
workshop.

Information on how to submit a paper including the correct format, page length
and other constraints can be found [here](/submission).
